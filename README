This Project consists of a Single Agent representing a Vaccum Cleaner Robot 
	in a grid environment. There's a second agent but it only act as a View
	to what is happening.

To run use the params: 
	"-gui -agents mo:br.unb.sma.MOVaccumCleaner.MO;viewer:br.unb.sma.MOVaccumCleaner.spike.Viewer -local-host 127.0.0.1"

* Vaccum Cleaner Robot:
	- Name: MO (in allusion to the Microbe Obliterator of the Movie Wall-E).
	- PAGE:
		- Perceptions: 
			- Environment is a bi-dimensional Grid with configurable size. 
				So its 'location' is determined by the coordinates x,y
			- Each cell of the grid can be 'Dirty' or 'Clean'.
		- Actions: The robot is able to perform the following actions:
			- Move (right, left, up or Down): which advances him one position 
				on each direction (when not on the edges).
			- Clean : Which changes the state of the floor to 'Clean'.
		- Goals:
			- Clean if dirty.
			- Move to find more dirt.
		- Environment:
			- Accessible: Since all information about the environment is directly 
				and instantaneous provided to the agent.
			- Deterministic: Since both actions have clear output results.
				Eg: Moving changes the position and Cleaning changes the state.
			- Non-Episodic: The decision made regarding either to clean or not to
				clean would be episodic. But the agent consider that every cell
				that was visited in the past is already clean. That's why the 
				agent never go back. 
			- Static: Since no other agent takes action on the Environment.
			- Discrete: The possible states and actions are very well limited.
			- Single Agent: Beside the "EVE" agent (the viewer), only MO takes 
				action on the environment.

* Dirty Maker Robot:
	- Name: WALL-E (in allusion to the Waste Allocation Load Lifter - Earth 
		Class of the Movie Wall-E).
	- PAGE:
		- Perceptions: 
			- Environment is a bi-dimensional Grid with configurable size. 
				So its 'location' is determined by the coordinates x,y
		- Actions: The robot is able to perform the following actions:
			- Move (right, left, up or Down): which advances him one position 
				on each direction (when not on the edges).
			- Mess : Which changes the state of the floor to 'Dirty'.
		- Goals:
			- Dirty if clean.
			- Move to find more cells to mess with.
		- Environment:
			- Accessible: Since all information about the environment is directly 
				and instantaneous provided to the agent.
			- Deterministic: Since both actions have clear output results.
				Eg: Moving changes the position and Messing changes the state.
			- Episodic: The decision made regarding either to mess or not to
				mess is random not taking into account any other info. 
			- Dynamic: Since MO can clean the cells wich WALL-E messed with.
			- Discrete: The possible states and actions are limited.
			- Multiple Agent: Both WALL-E and MO can change the state of the 
				environment.

* Viewer:
	- Name : Auto (in allusion to the Auto Pilot Central Computer
		 of the Movie Wall-E).
	- PAGE:
		- Perceptions: 
			- Environment is a bi-dimensional Grid with configurable size. 
			- Each cell of the grid can be 'Dirty' or 'Clean'.
			- Each cell can have a MO or Not.
		- Actions: The robot is able to perform the following actions:
			- Show: Shows a representation of the environment.
	- Goals:
		- Observe and provide a representation of the environment.
	- Environment:
		- Accessible: Since all information about the environment is directly 
			and instantaneous provided to the agent.
		- Deterministic: Auto does not change the environment.
		- Episodic: The action is only based on the current state.
		- Dynamic: Since Auto can't change the state of the environment, from
			its point of view, the environment is changed against its will.
		- Discrete: The possible states and actions are very well limited.
		- Single Agent: Only MO takes action on the environment.
